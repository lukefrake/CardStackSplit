# Card Stacks React

I decided to make this fresh in React as when I started trying to make the previous code performant I started pulling a lot out.

As I'm only handeling a handful of animations I'm able to create them in just CSS.

Slight flicker present in IE11 that's down to preserve 3d, this could be corrected by duplicating the DOM, if I get time I'll come back to this.
